            <h2>Why New York City</h2>
            <h3>New York City, also known as the big apple</h3>
            <p>
              New York, New York, the most populous city in the United States,
              has been given many nicknames, including The City That Never
              Sleeps, Empire City, and Gothamâ€”but perhaps the most famous one of
              all is the Big Apple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout its history, the term "big apple" has always come down
              to simply mean the best and biggest of places to be, and New York
              City has long lived up to its nickname. Once you visit this
              seven-mile-long city, you'll truly understand why it's called the
              Capital of the World and the Big Apple.
